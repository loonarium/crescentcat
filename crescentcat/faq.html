<h2>Why are you guys open every day?</h2>
<p>
Crescent Cat Rescue has been operating that way for over 25+ years! It allows us to see cats as often as possible, without causing issues for our staff. As we are <em>not</em> an emergency veterinary office, we do not operate for 24 hours a day. 
</p>

<h2>Are you guys hiring?</h2>
<p>
We do quarterly hiring and volunteering opportunities! There will be an announcement a few days before applications are released on our social medias! @crescentcat on twitter, instagram and facebook.
</p>

<h2>Can I donate?</h2>
<p id="time">
Absolutely! All donations go towards supplying the cats, and any excess donations at the end of the year will get re-donated to another shelter that is in need. We appreciate everything! We also take donations in the form of <u>general</u> pet supplies and toys (i.e. no food, treats, or pet desserts; we accept pet beds, litter, non-plastic cat toys, etc.)
